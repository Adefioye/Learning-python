This is a lovely document. You can tell that it's lovely, because it uses the words lovely and
wonderful many many times. Some documents don't tell you that they're wonderful or lovely. That's a
mistake. Truly wonderful documents will make it explicit how lovely they actually are, since that's
a "competitive advantage." That's that and that's all I'll say about that.
