    "Web accessibility has tto do with making web content and user interface available to a broad audience. Especially for people with cognitive, auditory and visual disabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 concepts that are crucially important for these are:\n",
    "- Have well-structured codes with appropriate mark-up\n",
    "- Ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content\n",
    "- Create easily navigable webpage that is keyboard friendly\n",
    "\n",
    "Having accessible web content is an ongoing challenge. A great resource for your projects going forward is the W3 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). They set the international standard for accessibility and provide a number of criteria you can use to check your work."

    "- h1 to h6 should be properly used to show correct hierarchical relationships amongst the content of a webpage\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTML5 added new elements to aid developers while also improving accessibility features. Example are: main, header, footer, nav, article, and section, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"main\" tag is used to sorround the central topic of a webpage. It has an embedded landmark feature that assisitive technology can use to navigate to the main content. Example, \"Jump to Main Content\" link is automatically given to assisitive devices if a main tag is featured in the markup language of the webpage.\n",

    "- Distinction between div, section and article elements\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>: groups unrelated content\n",
    "<section>: groups related content\n",
    "<article>: groups independent and self-contained content\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"header\" tag is used for wrapping introductory info and navigation links of the parent tag and works well around content that is repeated on multiple pages. \"header\" shares embedded landmark feature we saw with \"main\" allowing assistive technologies to navigate to the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B: It is important to note that the \"header\" is meant for use in the \"body\" tag. This is different than the \"head\" element which contains the page's title and meta information \n",
    "\n",
    "- \"nav\" tag is a newly created element in HTML5. It also has embedded landmark features that increase accessibility. It is meant to wrap around the main navigation links of a webpage. If there are repeated links on the bottom of the page. \"footer\" header is sufficient for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTML5s \"audio\" element gives semantic meaning to a code to increase accessibility. it is wrapped aound sound/ audio stream content. It helps people with auditory disabilities. This can be done by adding text alternatives or link to audio transcript. \n",
    "N.B: The audio element supports \"controls\" attribute which helps to create play/plause and other controls needed for interacting with the audio components. The code is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<audio id=\"meowClip\" controls>\n",
    "    <source src=\"audio/meow.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n",
    "    <source src=\"audio/meow.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\">\n",
    "</audio>\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTML5 \"figure\" and \"figcaption\" these are used to wrap visual representations (diagrams/images/charts) and their captions. It has a combined benefit of semantically grouping related contents and adding text alternatives. For data visuals, the caption should be used to detail the trends/conclusions of the chart.\n",
    "N.B: <figcaption> element is a child of <figure> element\n",
    "\n",
    "- <label> tag wraps texts for specific form control usually name or label for a choice. The \"for\" attribute of a label tag explicitly associates the form to the form controls and used by screen readers.\n",

    "- Low contrast between foreground and background makes text difficult to read. Sufficient contrast is necessary to make text easy to read. \"Sufficient contrast\" is a phrase defined by the \"Web content accessibility guideline\" to mean a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 to 1. This is usually calculated by processing the relative luminance values of the two colors. There are online programs that can help to compute the contrast ratio of a webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The contrast ratio can be tweaked by using hsl() method to set the color we want. Shading and tinting are usually done by tweaking the lightness value. \n",

    "- To make link text accessible, descriptive names should be used so as to make screen-reader users make good sense of the links on the webpage. Populating all links with link texts like \"Click here\" and \"Read more\" do not help the screen-reader users make lots of sense with the information on the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTML \"accesskey\" attribute is used to make a webpage element easily accessible esp. for people using only keyboard to interact with the computer. This atrribute can be used by any element. However, it is particularly useful for intercative elements like links, radio-buttons and form controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"tabindex\" can be used to bring keyboard focus to an element. Interactive elements such as links and form controls usually are tab-focused and this is done inline with the position of the elements on the page. This keyboard focus can be applied to other elements like \"span, div and p\" elements by setting their \"tabindex=0\".\n",
